    <ol>
        <li> 
            Heat 1 teaspoon of oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves and saute for few seconds.
            <br>
            Then add the the onion, garlic, ginger and saute for 2 to 3 minutes until the onion is translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the tomatoes and cashews and mix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add 1 cup of water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the pan and cook on medium heat for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After 15 minutes, remove the pan from heat. Remove the bay leaf, cinnamon stick and cloves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the mixture cool down a bit and then transfer to a blender. Itâ€™s important to let it cool down a bit else it will all blow up from the mixer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grind the masala to a smooth paste and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            To the same pan now add 2 tablespoons butter along with remaining 1 teaspoon oil on medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the butter melts, add the red chili powder and the Kashmiri red chili powder and fry for few seconds. This will give the curry a nice red color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add the ground paste back into the pan along with the garam masala (start with 1/2 teaspoon and add the remaining 1/4 teaspoon at the end only if you feel like the curry needs that extra bit of garam masala), cardamom powder, sugar, salt and tomato paste (if using).
            <br>
            Mix well and cook for 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Then add the cream and mix.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add in the paneer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on medium heat. Finally add crushed kasuri methi.
        </li>
        <li>
            Garnish paneer butter masala with cilantro and serve hot with naan or rice!
